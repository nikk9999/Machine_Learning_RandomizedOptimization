# Machine_Learning_RandomizedOptimization
ABAGAIL Java Library is used to analyse the following four randomized optimization algorithms.
1. Randomized Hill Climbing
2. Simulated Annealing
3. Genetic Algorithm
4. MIMIC

A neural network is trained using first three algorithms instead of backpropagation.
All four of them are used to optimize Travelling Salesman, KnapSack and Flipflop problems.
